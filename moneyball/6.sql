-- Sort by total hits, highest to lowest.
-- Your query should return two columns, one for the teams’ names and one for their total hits in 2001.
SELECT teams.name, 




-- SELECT players.first_name, players.last_name, salaries.salary FROM players
-- INNER JOIN salaries ON players.id = salaries.player_id
